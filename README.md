# Introduction to Web Development

This is the sketch of a course for basic Full-Stack Web Development in Django and React. Prerequisites are basic understanding of programming (for loops, branching, functions, simple OOP). Estimated time of completion is 10-20 hours.

Example sets are provided to illustrate concepts in a step-by-step answer, making reference to the starter code provided.

Problem sets are tasks to develop code based on the examples. 

[TODO] Over the vacation make this into a standalone course like the odin project (maybe with animations?!)
