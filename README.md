# Introduction to Web Development

[Go to Chapter 1](notes/c1-overview.md)

## System Requirements
In decreasing order of priority:
- Working computer (Any OS fine, -nix based preferred for deployment)
- Internet Connection
- Python 3, latest version
- npm (Node Package Manager)
    - create-react-app 
- Postman Account (for the API demo)

## Course Structure

The course is split into 9 parts as follows

1. High-Level Overview
2. Basic SWE Toolkit
3. Backend Server Demo
4. Frontend Server Demo

5. Backend Server Practical Exercise
6. Frontend Server Practical Exercise
7. Deployment
8. Further SWE Toolkit

First, we will introduce the high level concepts in Web Development. (Module 1)

Then, we will play around with some foundational commands and workflows such as setting up virtual environments, managing dependencies and traversing a Unix directory. (Module 2)

Following which, we will take a look at a sample Backend and Frontend and see what is happening. (Modules 3-4)

Then, we will try to implement something similar from scratch. We can implement the existing one or a different one. (Modules 5-6)

We will deploy our newly created project online (Module 7)

And explore other workflows that are very crucial in the SWE process despite not being necessary to complete modules 1-7. (Module 8)


## Objectives

- Organisation: To appreciate how separation of concern and code reuse is achieved through
    - client-server structure of communication, 
    - frontend-backend server distinction,
    - MVP architecture,
    - Inheritance

- Able to code a simple app
    - Implementing a schema containing two or more entities sharing a relationship
    - Implementing API endpoints for CRUD operations for given entities including a filter-based view
    - Implementing a frontend to perform the CRUD operations using Material UI in a table-based presentation


## Motivation


This is a introduction to basic Full Stack (Backend-Frontend) Web Development in Django and React. The goal of the course is to teach the minimum set of concepts, in order for students to start writing simple applications that can do basic operations as quickly as possible (without caring too much about performance, security or implementation details).

The Prerequisites are:
- Basic Programming Ideas
    - Variables, Primitive Types, Operations (addition, printing, etc.)
    - Basic Control flow (For/while loops, if/else, try/except, functions)
    - Basic OOP (Classes - State and Methods, Inheriting a class)

Time of completion should be around 10-20 hours.

The inspiration behind the course (and the local-library example) is The Odin Project which offers two routes (JavaScript and Ruby on Rails). My idea is to adapt it into a Django-React stack.

Also, many programming bootcamps / courses seem to just info-dump, the vision for this course is to build up concepts in a progressive structure, where each step builds on previous ideas.

Currently, this is just supporting material. Over the summer I may consider developing it with more content to make it into a standalone course similar to Odin Project. Maybe with animations and more visual graphics!
