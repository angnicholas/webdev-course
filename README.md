# Introduction to Web Development

I am attempting to teach my friend basic Web Development in Django and React over a weekend. This is the supplementary material that I am using.

Prerequisites. Basic understanding of programming (for loops, branching, functions, simple OOP). 

Estimated time of completion is (hopefully) 10-20 hours.

The inspiration behind the course (and the local-library example) is The Odin Project which offers two routes (JavaScript and Ruby on Rails). My idea is to adapt it into a Django-React stack.

Currently, the material is insufficient to be standalone. Over the vacation, I may consider making this into a standalone course similar to Odin Project. Maybe with animations and more visual graphics!

## Course Structure

The course is split into 9 parts as follows

1. High-Level Overview (10 mins)
2. Basic SWE Toolkit (30 mins)
3. Backend Server Demo (1h)
4. Frontend Server Demo (1h)

5. Backend Server Code-along (2h)
6. Frontend Server Code-along (2h)
7. Deployment (1h)
8. Further SWE Toolkit (1h)

First, we will introduce the high level concepts in Web Development. (Module 1)

Then, we will play around with some foundational commands and workflows such as setting up virtual environments, managing dependencies and traversing a Unix directory. (Module 2)

Following which, we will take a look at a sample Backend and Frontend and see what is happening. (Modules 3-4)

Then, we will try to implement something similar from scratch. We can implement the existing one or a different one. (Modules 5-6)

We will deploy our newly created project online (Module 7)

And explore other workflows that are very crucial in the SWE process despite not being necessary to complete modules 1-7. (Module 8)
