# Problem Set 1. Tripos Searcher

Now we can apply what we have learnt to make an index of Tripos Questions. Typically we might want to inform the design with some basic user research as well.

## Design Work

2. Design the user journeys 
3. Define the API endpoints

## Backend
4. Implement the API endpoints in the backend

Done! Deploy it on Heroku and give users to try, gather feedback, iterate.
