# Module 4: Frontend Demonstration

We shall now run the frontend application in tandem with the backend. Notice that we have started two distinct servers on our computers, the backend on port ```3000``` and the frontend on port ```8000```. This simulates, on our own computer, two web servers communicating with each other! 

As we click around on the webpage, the communication is like this:

Browser -> Frontend -> Backend -> Frontend -> Browser

## Run the application

Run the frontend server in tandem with the backend (Open a new shell)
```npm install```
```npm start``` 

## Overview

Tbh I'm quite bad at frontend. But it's mostly just code the components in a structure and then use the React Inspector to look at where the elements are.

Then use Console to view what is happening (request traces etc.)

Javascript is basically bloatware (Look at the size of node-packages!!!!!)
