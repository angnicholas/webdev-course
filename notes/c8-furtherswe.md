## 8.1. Writing Documentation (in Markdown)
Writing documentation is important because it allows your future self (and others) to know what you are doing!!

- Probably important in a real job too

Markdown has
- lists
    - a
1. numbers
    - x

```codeblocks```

```python
def syntax_highlighting():
    print("lol!")

Minimally, a project should have a ```README.md``` file in the top-level directory - so that whe you go back and look at your code six months from now you know 
1. how to run it
2. what it does 
3. some troubleshooting steps if necessary
4. what types of drugs you were on when you decided ```convert_heading_from_degrees_to_radians_version_2``` was an acceptable name for a function.
