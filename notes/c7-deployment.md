# Module 7: Deployment
I think Deployment is important in any course because it is a good source of motivation when you can publish your work and let your friends play with it!! Doing everything on ```localhost``` doesn't make you feel like a real developer! 

1. Heroku and Github pages
2. Free vs paid hosting plans (aws)
3. Keeping your secrets secret (eg. the django-secret-key) using environment variables (Security issues, for now, can ignore)
