# Module 1: High-Level Overview

1. Motivation: Want computers to talk to each other. Solution: Send data via a protocol (Internet)

2. Web is one way of doing this. Involves sites 
    - static content (blog) 
    - stateful content (online shopping)

3. Client Server model of HTTP. One way of sending information is using a client-server model. The client initiates the communication by sending a request, and the server responds with a response.

2. HTTP Request: 
    - method / verb (GET, PUT, POST)
    - URL (http://example.org/test/a/b/c/)
    - Headers (not v impt)
    - Payload.
    - ```Live Example: Postman, Python requests```

3. Backend-Frontend architecture: 
    - Frontend concerned about serving content (styling, etc.)
    - Backend concerned about managing state centrally (eg. users interacting with one another)
